# High Performance Computing for Cryptography

This repository contains the project **High Performance Computing for Cryptography** developed as part of the M2P SCCI program at **Ensimag-Ujf** by **Abdourahmane SAKHO**, **Ali MKHIDA**, and **Maad EL YADARI**.

## Overview

The project explores various computational techniques to improve the efficiency of cryptographic algorithms, with a special focus on high-performance computing (HPC). The goal is to optimize operations related to cryptography, such as key recovery and speeding up computations, while maintaining secure and reliable implementations.

### Key Topics Covered:
- Transitioning from **Canonical basis to Normal basis**.
- Discovering and applying **Isomorphisms** in cryptographic structures.
- **Speeding up computations** on the parameter Î´, which plays a critical role in certain cryptographic algorithms.
- Implementing an efficient **Non-Lookup Table (Non-LUT)** solution for cryptographic operations.
- **Recovering secret keys** through optimized techniques.
- **Achieving high throughput** (up to 200 MHz) for designs using the **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**.
- Engaging in **Practical Work** to solidify these concepts.

This project aims to balance speed, security, and practicality in cryptographic implementations using cutting-edge techniques in high-performance computing.
